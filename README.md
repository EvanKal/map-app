# AtheniaN Project

This is a single page app that displays information about my favourite
places to eat and grab a snack in Athens. The app has been devoloped using REACT.

## Install

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
  ** All dependencies will be automatically installed through the package.json file
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Third Party API

All information about the locations, are currently retrieved through the Foursquare API

## Page styling

The page has a different display pattern than that of the DOM tree. The DOM tree follows an accessibility first logic.

## Service worker

The page utilizes a custom service worker, that is generated by the native registerServiceWorker.js component ("service-worker.js"). The custon affordances are being from the sw.js file. The SW caches all the native dependencies of the app (index, css, js files etc), as well as all the of requests being made.
